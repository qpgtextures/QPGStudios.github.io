            <h4>The Thief Of The Cave Of The Kaala pahadhi</h4>
                <p>Once upon a time, a policeman went to the market. After taking the required<br> goods, he went to the billing counter. When he was giving the money to the cashier, a thief stole the the money from the policeman's hand. The policeman said, "You thief, stop right there!",  and ran after him, but the thief managed to run away from the policeman.

                    The next day, the policeman took full police force to find the thief. They<br> all searched with a lot of determination. Then, one of the policemen found him and informed the others.
                    
                    Then they took the thief to the police station. The policemen inquired where<br> had he kept the money. He answered that it was kept in Taj Hotel, room no. 143. Then the sub-inspector told the others to leave the thief free.
                    
                    Then, the policeman, along with his force went in the Taj Hotel, asked on the<br> reception for the key of room no. 143 and entered the room, but found nothing! The policeman then suspected whether the thief lied. So the policeman, along with his force, again went in the search of the thief and found the him in a single hour.
                    
                    Now the policemen again asked him that where was the money. This time, he answered<br> that it was kept in the "Cave of the Kaala Pahadhi" . Now even the thief had to agree to come with the policeman. When they reached the cave, the police force secretly joined them.
                    
                    The policeman commanded the thief to being the other person, with the money, with<br> him. After a few minutes , the thief came with the other person. The policeman got to know that the person with the thief was his boss.
                    
                    And so, the policeman arrested the two thieves, took the money from them, and<br> returned it to the cashier.
